    <h1>Spinach Lentil Dahl</h1>
    <img src="lentils.jpeg" alt="Dahl" width="500" height="650">
    <p>This dahl is a quicker lighter variation featuring red lentils and spinach.  Something like a dahl makhani with slow simmered puy lentils and red kidney beans finished with butter and cream is at the opposite end of the dahl spectrum of richness, so the flavour comes more from it's freshness and the fried spices.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Red lentils</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander (Cilantro)</li>
        <li>Green chili</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Black mustard seed</li>
        <li>Cumin seed</li>
        <li>Coriander seed</li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Cloves</li>
        <li>Cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by rinsing and covering your lentils with water, then simmer on low.  Add turmeric, sliced ginger, and a halved green chili.</li>
        <li>Dice your onion, and finely chop ginger garlic and chili.</li>
        <li>Heat a neutral oil, like canola, over medium high heat.  Add your whole spices: cumin, mustard seed, cinnamon, cloves and coriander seed.  They will crackle immediately in the hot oil.  Add your minced ginger/garlic/chili, stir through quickly, then add your onions before anything starts to burn.</li>
        <li>Season with salt.  This will cook down quickly, while softening the onion add garam masala.  After this add chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>This mixture doesn't need to cook for very long, just until the tomatoes are starting to cook down.  Check your lentil mixture, if they have all softened add the entire mixture to your spice mixture pan.</li>
        <li>This can simmer for some time until everything is incorporate, and left to simmer.  Chop spinach and add shortly before serving, giving it just enough time to wilt down.  Season with salt, lemon, chopped coriander and more garam masala.</li>
    </ol>
