<p>Shakshuka (shakshouka) can be made a variety of different ways, I would say that there are certain guidelines that need to be followed, but considering that it translates to "mixture" in arabic, there are no hard and fast rules I've seen followed.  Upon some light research I just found that it is originally a north african dish developed in the 16th century following the introduction of tomatoes to the area by Cortes. making it one of the original old world tomato dishes, before or concurrent with their introduction to Italy and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The one constant for Shakshuka is that eggs are poached in a thick sauce, and a surefire sign of authenticity is that they are served in the pan that they were cooked in.  Apart from this, there is incredible variety when it comes to regional methods of cooking.  Merguez sausage, harissa, spinach, goat's cheese, preserved lemon, olives, even potatoes and broad beans can be added.  This is a base recipe I would say adheres to a purist variation containing spiced tomatoes, peppers, onions and garlic.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Red bell peppers</li>
    <li>Ripe tomatoes</li>
    <li>Yellow onion</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Cumin seeds</li>
    <li>Fresh or dried thyme</li>
    <li>Red pepper flakes or cayenne</li>
    <li>Coriander powder</li>
    <li>Paprika</li>
</ul>
    
<ol>
    <li>Slice your peppers and onions thinly, mince garlic and chop tomatoes, pick fresh thyme.  Heat a thick bottomed pan over medium high heat and add a decent amount of olive oil.</li>
    <li>Once oil is hot add cumin seeds and chili flakes, they should start to crackle immediately.  Add your peppers, onions thyme and garlic right away and season with a bit of salt.</li>
    <li>Once this begins to cook down and soften add coriander powder and paprika.  Cook these spices for a short amount of time to toast and incorporate, then add your chopped tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook this mixture until it thickens, then season again with salt if needed.  This can be done ahead of time and left in the fridge.</li>
    <li>To cook the eggs, create small divots in the mixtures and crack the eggs into them.  Use a deep pan that is the appropriate size to fill most of the space with the amount of eggs you want to cook.  Cover and poach the eggs until desired yolk consistency.  It is also possible to finish the eggs in the oven at around 350-400 degrees F for a more even cook on the eggs, provided it is oven safe.</li>
    <li>Top with either parsley or coriander, lemon, olive oil, goats cheese, feta, tahini, as your wish.</li>
