    <h2>Cooking method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your onions by roughly dicing them.  Either finely mince or blend together the garlic, green chilies and ginger and leave to the side.  If you would like to you can also finely chop the cleaned stems from the fresh coriander.</li>
        <li>Add ghee or oil to a heavy bottomed pan over medium heat, and then add your whole spices: cinnamon stick,green cardamom pods, cumin seed and bay leaf.  Cook until cumin begins to crackle, this will happen quickly if the pan is already hot and can burn, then add your onions and some salt. </li>
        <li>Once onions have softened add your ground spices: coriander, cumin, turmeric and kashmiri chili powder.  Then add your cashews, ginger/garlic/chili mixture, and coriander stems if desired.</li>
        <li>Cook this mixture for 4-5 minutes, adding small amounts of water if it gets to dry and the powdered spices begin to stick.  After this add your chopped or canned tomatoes and begin to reduce.</li>
        <li>Once this mixture has cooked down and the tomatoes are well combined remove the bay leaf and cinnamon stick, then add the mixture to a large blender or food processor.  Blend until smooth and then add back to the pan directly, or pass through a fine mesh sieve for a smoother mixture.</li>
        <li>Season this mixture with salt and garam masala, continuing to cook on medium to low heat, adding water to loosen if it gets too thick.  Season your cubes of paneer with salt, garam masala, and a bit of kashmiri chili powder, then lightly brown in a separate pan over medium/high heat.  Once ready, add to the butter masala and finish with cream, fresh chopped coriander and a bit of lemon.  Check for seasoning and combine</li>
